## Training Description

This training introduces the main competencies for graduate students and researchers entering their first undergraduate mentoring experience with the Materials Initiative for Comprehensive Research Opportunity (MICRO). During the first session, we will reflect on past mentoring experience, the peculiarities of mentoring undergraduate researchers in a remote setup, as well as introduce MICRO’s format, the program components, and logistics. After this introduction, we will sequentially emphasize four main competencies for entering mentoring: (1) Defining a research project and aligning expectations, (2) Planning and managing remote research tasks, (3) Effective and inclusive communication in a remote setup, and (4) Fostering independence. Last, towards the end of the semester, we will provide insights on preparing the end-of-term discussion between mentors and mentees. The interactive and methodical approach presented in this training is designed to help mentors develop skills for engaging in a productive, culturally-responsive relationship with their mentees. Each section will be accompanied by worksheets and additional material to guide the mentors through putting into practice the competencies learned. 

## Desired Learning Outcomes

By the end of this training, mentors will be able to:

- Articulate expectations for the research project based on shared goals.
- Define the undergraduate research project in terms of manageable scope, the relevant milestones, and the means to measure progress.
- Structure remote undergraduate mentoring and implement tools for information and data sharing.
- Provide critical feedback in a constructive and inclusive way to the mentee to assist them in reaching their full research potential.
- Foster mentee independence through the development of a network of mentors that they can reach out to for guidance and help on relevant questions.
- Know relevant resources for support and guidance for mentoring issues.

## Training Materials

Training will synthesize material from the following references.
