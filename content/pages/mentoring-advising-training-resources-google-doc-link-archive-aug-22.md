Mentoring & advising faculty training programs: Link [https://docs.google.com/document/d/137giDqegr-fVoXL0SrcomfxTMcME3vJVgjDCK5Lrdpc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137giDqegr-fVoXL0SrcomfxTMcME3vJVgjDCK5Lrdpc/edit)

[1\. CIMER-Center for Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (Univ. of Wisconsin)](https://cimerproject.org/): 

Most established program in the country. Extensive programming and training for faculty and for facilitators. Evidence shown in a randomized controlled trial with 283 mentor-mentee pairings from 16 institutions (see [here](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2014/05000/Training_Mentors_of_Clinical_and_Translational.26.aspx) for paper and here for [summary](https://cimerproject.org/#/curricula/recruiting) of results)

For types of trainings offered see [here](https://cimerproject.org/#/services/training). They are also happy to consult about development and adaptation of training curricula.

Extensive [facilitator guides](https://health.usf.edu/medicine/mdprogram/rise/scholarsresources/~/media/FBB05459BD6B4396BB76725C85BAFF9E.ashx) available (this is just one example). They include case studies.

[Packaged training materials](https://cimerproject.org/#/completeCurricula/mentor) are available by field. From what we can tell, the trainings are similar from one field to another. For an example: 8-week training program from “Multidisciplinary Research Mentor Training” looks like this:

[Guidelines for planning](https://cimerproject.org/#/curricula/planning):

Group Size: We recommend 8-12 participants for the full 8-hour mentor training. Facilitation data indicates this size is optimal for achieving the appropriate level of discussion. Our mentor training is a process-based curriculum that relies heavily on the experiences and contributions of each participant. We do not recommend allowing observers to join the group for the full 8-hour mentor training. This can be disruptive to the trust and rapport that develops within the group.

Implementation Plan: the following questions will help you determine what you need to implement research mentee training at your institution:

Who is your target audience?

In what format will your training be delivered? (e.g., course for academic credit, course for professional development, workshop)

When will you implement your training? (e.g., summer, semester, evenings, weekend)

Will your training be integrated into or serve an existing program (e.g., undergraduate research program, graduate training program, fellows training program), or will it stand alone? If integrated, how will it be organized within the existing programmatic framework?

How many mentees do you plan to train in your first round of implementation?

What recruitment strategies will you use?

Who will facilitate and/or co-facilitate the training?

What resources, if any, are already committed to support implementation? What other resources could you leverage? (e.g., funding, administrative help)

How will you evaluate the effectiveness of your training?

What else do you need to get started?

 

Evaluation resources from CIMER can be found [here](https://cimerproject.org/#/evaluation/mentor-training).

 

[2\. Mentoring Skills Workshop (Stanford School of Medicine)](http://med.stanford.edu/academy/programs/mentoring-skills-workshop-series.html)

They have 3 different programs to support good mentoring and advising practices:

Advising award (typically accompanied by a small amount of money)

Coaching services: Coaching services are between a senior mentor and participants. Senior mentors are volunteers that they recruit. Typically two types of participants take advantage of this service: mentors who are already doing a really good job and mentors who because of low performance are referred to them. They would love for more folks to take advantage of this service before they are referred to them.

Mentoring Skills Workshop Series:

~12 faculty participate. They limit their training to 20.

3 sessions feels about right mostly because it is the bare minimum that they feel should be covered - in fact they do get asked to offer this sort of training in less sessions.

Each session has a lot of interactive components and role play where mentors are practicing the tools they are provided with for giving feedback, communicating, etc.

Other: 

They also provide a very basic 1-hour training that is akin to their Session 1 below during new faculty orientation.

They have also been asked to do unit trainings where everyone within a unit participates (ex: radiology, etc.)

 

Curriculum for Mentoring Skills Workshop:

Session 1: Introduction to Mentoring and Giving Feedback: Be aware of the characteristics of a good mentor; know the responsibilities of a mentor; know the responsibilities of a mentee; understand the principles of giving feedback; be able to apply a model of feedback in a mentoring relationship

Session 2: Relationship Management, Communication and Resolving Challenges: Understand the components of Emotional Intelligence (EI); realize how you can enhance your EI to improve your mentoring; realize the importance of self-reflection for effective mentoring; know essential communication skills to enhance your mentoring abilities; be able to reflect on mentoring challenges to improve your ability to mentor

Session 3: Mentoring Across Generational Difference: Describe the mentoring relationship continuum; mentor effectively across generations; adjust your feedback to different communication styles; give effective feedback in challenging situations

[3\. Mentoring in Research (Stanford, Office of Postdoctoral Affairs)](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/events/series/mentoring-research)

2-day workshops for postdocs (a video & slides of a short workshop named the same can be found [here](https://vpge.stanford.edu/resources/mentoring-research-skills-mentoring))

 

[4\. Clinical & Translational Research Mentoring Training Program (UCSF)](http://accelerate.ucsf.edu/training/mtp)

Lots of mentoring training resources available within this site related to their course materials on 9 topics ranging from communication, diversity, and work-life balance, to institutional orientation and leadership skills. Of most interest might be their [extensive library of case studies](http://accelerate.ucsf.edu/training/mdp-cases).

 

[5\. Faculty Mentoring Workshop (Univ. of Washington)](https://ictr.wisc.edu/mentoring/)

Based on a curriculum called “Mentor Training for Clinical and Translational Researchers” (developed by CIMER above) which is an 8, 2-hour workshop series.

 

[6\. Faculty Mentorship Workshop (Indiana School of Medicine)](https://www.mededportal.org/publication/9778/)

Materials from this multiple-session workshop are provided for download (left of the page). Skill-building sessions included are: “Characteristics of Effective Mentors,” “Maintaining the Mentoring Relationship,” and “Generational Issues and Mentoring,” to name a few. Additional tools include a mentoring self-assessment form and a workshop evaluation.
