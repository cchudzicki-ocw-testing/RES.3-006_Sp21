0\. The 2019 National Academies Report [The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEMM](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-science-of-effective-mentoring-in-stemm)

[1\. CIMER-Center for Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (University of Wisconsin)](https://cimerproject.org/)

This is the most established program in the country with extensive programming and training for faculty and for facilitators. Evidence is shown in a randomized controlled trial with 283 mentor-mentee pairings from 16 institutions (see [here](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2014/05000/Training_Mentors_of_Clinical_and_Translational.26.aspx) for paper and here for a [summary](https://cimerproject.org/#/curricula/recruiting) of results). For types of training offered see [here](https://cimerproject.org/#/services/training).  Extensive [facilitator guides](https://health.usf.edu/medicine/mdprogram/rise/scholarsresources/~/media/FBB05459BD6B4396BB76725C85BAFF9E.ashx) are available that include case studies. [Packaged training materials](https://cimerproject.org/#/completeCurricula/mentor) are available by field, as well as [guidelines for planning](https://cimerproject.org/#/curricula/planning). Evaluation resources from CIMER can be found [here](https://cimerproject.org/#/evaluation/mentor-training).

 

[2\. Mentoring Skills Workshop (Stanford School of Medicine)](http://med.stanford.edu/academy/programs/mentoring-skills-workshop-series.html)

They have 3 different programs to support good mentoring and advising practices:

Advising award (typically accompanied by a small amount of money)

Coaching services: Coaching services are between a senior mentor and participants. Senior mentors are volunteers that they recruit. Typically two types of participants take advantage of this service: mentors who are already doing a really good job and mentors who because of low performance are referred to them. They would love for more folks to take advantage of this service before they are referred to them.

Mentoring Skills Workshop Series:

~12 faculty participate. They limit their training to 20.

3 sessions feels about right mostly because it is the bare minimum that they feel should be covered - in fact they do get asked to offer this sort of training in less sessions.

Each session has a lot of interactive components and role play where mentors are practicing the tools they are provided with for giving feedback, communicating, etc.

Other: 

They also provide a very basic 1-hour training that is akin to their Session 1 below during new faculty orientation.

They have also been asked to do unit trainings where everyone within a unit participates (ex: radiology, etc.)

 

Curriculum for Mentoring Skills Workshop:

Session 1: Introduction to Mentoring and Giving Feedback: Be aware of the characteristics of a good mentor; know the responsibilities of a mentor; know the responsibilities of a mentee; understand the principles of giving feedback; be able to apply a model of feedback in a mentoring relationship

Session 2: Relationship Management, Communication and Resolving Challenges: Understand the components of Emotional Intelligence (EI); realize how you can enhance your EI to improve your mentoring; realize the importance of self-reflection for effective mentoring; know essential communication skills to enhance your mentoring abilities; be able to reflect on mentoring challenges to improve your ability to mentor

Session 3: Mentoring Across Generational Difference: Describe the mentoring relationship continuum; mentor effectively across generations; adjust your feedback to different communication styles; give effective feedback in challenging situations

[3\. Mentoring in Research (Stanford, Office of Postdoctoral Affairs)](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/events/series/mentoring-research)

Lots of mentoring training resources available within this site related to their course materials on 9 topics ranging from communication, diversity, and work-life balance, to institutional orientation and leadership skills. Of most interest might be their [extensive library of case studies](http://accelerate.ucsf.edu/training/mdp-cases).

 

[5\. Faculty Mentoring Workshop (Univ. of Washington)](https://ictr.wisc.edu/mentoring/)

Based on a curriculum called “Mentor Training for Clinical and Translational Researchers” (developed by CIMER above) which is an 8, 2-hour workshop series.
