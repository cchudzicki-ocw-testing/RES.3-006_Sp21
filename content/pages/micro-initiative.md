MICRO is the *Materials Initiative for Comprehensive Research Opportunity* created to provide a remote research and education experience to undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds.

The program offers participants the ability to conduct cutting-edge materials research with MIT faculty while simultaneously being taught the fundamentals of materials science.

The MICRO initiative was developed by graduate students in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) and was initially supported by MIT Open Learningâ€™s J-WEL foundation.

This resource presents the MICRO curriculum and a set of mentoring resources developed specifically for this initiative.
